##Objective: 
Find a way to represent the metadata for an instrument so we can establish independent processes to consolidate and add existing metadata into this common place.

## The schema prototype is divided into the following sections:
* @context
The @context section defines the namespaces for the schema. The namespaces are used to identify the different types of properties that are used in the schema. 

* @id
The @id section defines the unique identifier for the dataset. The unique identifier is used to refer to the dataset in other documents.

* @type
The @type section defines the type of the dataset. The type of the dataset is schema:Dataset.

* dcterms:creator
The dcterms:creator section defines the creator of the dataset. The creator of the dataset is Dmitry Smirnov.

* dcterms:title
The dcterms:title section defines the title of the dataset. The title of the dataset is Dmitry Smirnov's Data Acquisition Info.

* soso:instrument
The soso:instrument section defines the name of the spectrometer used in the experiment. The spectrometer used in the experiment is HRS750.

* soso:magnetSystem
The soso:magnetSystem section defines the name of the magnet system used in the experiment. The magnet system used in the experiment is SCM3.

* soso:experimentType
The soso:experimentType section defines the type of experiment that was conducted. The type of experiment that was conducted is PL.

* soso:sampleShortName
The soso:sampleShortName section defines a short name for the sample that was studied. The sample that was studied is WSe2-MoSe2.

* soso:magneticField
The soso:magneticField section defines the strength of the magnetic field applied to the sample. The strength of the magnetic field is 0.0 Tesla.

* soso:temperature
The soso:temperature section defines the temperature of the sample. The temperature of the sample is 10.0 degrees Celsius.

* soso:lightSource
The soso:lightSource section defines the type of light source used in the experiment. The type of light source used in the experiment is 633nm-100uW.

* soso:centralFrequency
The soso:centralFrequency section defines the central frequency of the light source. The central frequency of the light source is 720.0 nanometers.

* soso:slit
The soso:slit section defines the width of the slit used in the experiment. The width of the slit is 30.0 micrometers.

* soso:acquisitionTime
The soso:acquisitionTime section defines the acquisition time of the experiment. The acquisition time of the experiment is 2.0 seconds.

* soso:objectiveNA
The soso:objectiveNA section defines the numerical aperture of the objective lens used in the experiment. The numerical aperture of the objective lens is 0.65.


The properties temperature, lightsource, centralFrequency, slit, acquisitionTime, and objectiveNA are separated from the rest of the properties in the schema prototype because they are specific to the experiment that was conducted. The other properties, such as @context, @id, @type, owner, manufacturer, description, are more general and are not specific to any particular experiment.

The properties temperature, lightsource, centralFrequency, slit, acquisitionTime, and objectiveNA are important for understanding the results of the experiment. The temperature of the sample can affect the way that light interacts with the sample, and the lightsource can affect the type of light that is used in the experiment. The central frequency of the lightsource can affect the energy of the light that is used in the experiment, and the slit can affect the amount of light that is used in the experiment. The acquisition time can affect the resolution of the experiment, and the objectiveNA can affect the magnification of the experiment.
By separating these properties from the rest of the properties in the schema prototype, it is easier to understand the specific details of the experiment that was conducted. This can be helpful for other scientists and researchers who are interested in replicating the experiment or who are interested in understanding the results of the experiment.
