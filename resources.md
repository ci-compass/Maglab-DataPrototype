    * provides a vocabulary of terms and properties for marking up structured data on web pages. This structured data can be used by search engines and other applications to better understand the content of a web page and provide richer search results and experiences. 
    * For example, if you have a web page about a product, you can use Schema.org to mark up the product's name, price, and availability. This will allow search engines to display richer results for your product, such as a star rating, a price comparison, or a link to the product's website.
